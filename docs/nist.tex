NIST Special Publication series 1500 is intended to capture external perspectives related to NIST 
standards, measurement, and testing-related efforts. These external perspectives can come from 
industry, academia, government, and others. These reports are intended to document external 
perspectives and do not represent official NIST positions.

Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document in order to describe an 
experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply recommendation or 
endorsement by NIST, nor is it intended to imply that the entities, materials, or equipment are necessarily the best 
available for the purpose. 

There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in 
accordance with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including concepts and 
methodologies, may be used by federal agencies even before the completion of such companion publications. Thus, 
until each publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain 
operative. For planning and transition purposes, federal agencies may wish to closely follow the development of 
these new publications by NIST. 

Organizations are encouraged to review all draft publications during public comment periods and provide feedback 
to NIST. All NIST publications are available at \url{http://www.nist.gov/publication-portal.cfm}.

%\paragraph{Reports on Computer Systems Technology}

The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at NIST promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by 
providing technical leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops 
tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance 
the development and productive use of information technology (IT). ITL’s responsibilities include the 
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the 
cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in federal 
information systems. This document reports on ITL’s research, guidance, and outreach efforts in IT and 
its collaborative activities with industry, government, and academic organizations.
